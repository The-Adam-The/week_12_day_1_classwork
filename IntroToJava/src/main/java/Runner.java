// SOLID principles

// Single-responsibility Principle -
    // A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

// Open-closed Principle -
    // Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

// Liskov Substitution Principle -
    // Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

// Interface  Segregation Principle -
    // A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

// Dependency Inversion Principle -
    //Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.



// 4 Pillars of OO APIE

// Abstraction -

// Encapsulation -

// Inheritance -

// Polymorphism -
